Essentially, send and receive txt messages via the web!

A simple web client that allows sending SMS messages via the [Twilio]() API and receive SMS messages that are then
forwarded to your email.

## Back Story

I hacked this together hours before traveling to Japan, so I could communicate with my Brother who could only talk via
SMS. As he was using Roaming with his phone carrier while there.

I spun up a free Heroku app and it actually worked a charm! :100: :ok_hand:

I haven't changed the app that much, merely tidied up the code for presentation and added some basic CSRF protection.
This app is still far from secure, use at your own risk :smile:.
